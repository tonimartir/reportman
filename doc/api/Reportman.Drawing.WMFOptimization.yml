  summary: >-
    This enumeration indicates diferent optimization implementations while drawing pages 

    (preview, web presentation or print). Microsoft .Net have an optimized graphic object, 

    called Windows Metafile, so when the same graphic operations must be done multiple times,

    they can be stored in it and "played" multiple times. This is the case for example, 

    when previewing a Report, you can go forward and backwards drawing again and again the

    same pages. If the engine have the capability of drawing multiple pages in the screen,

    like Report Manager Windows Forms preview does, the use of playing optimized windows

    metafiles can enhace performance, specially if the pages are dense (lot of text items).

    The drawbacks of playing metafiles is that they must be stored into memory, so when you

    optimize performance you hit memory consumption.
