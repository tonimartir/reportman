  summary: >-
    Enumeration indicating if the image should be shared, so only one instance of the image is stored

    while generating the report (ReportMetafile), if the image is repeated in the report, it's recommended

    to share it, so the image is stored only once, and not for each page (a internal reference is done).

    <xref href="Reportman.Reporting.Variant?text=ImageItem" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref>
  remarks: >-
    When exporting the Report to Adobe PDF format, it's recommended to share images that are repeated

    in each page, so the resulting file is smaller
  example: []
  syntax:
    content: public enum SharedImageType
    content.vb: Public Enum SharedImageType

    The image will be shared, for better performance, the reporting engine will assume that
                the image does not change in later drawings, recommended for page header logos for example

  syntax:
    content: Fixed = 1

    The image will be shared, but the engine must check it, so if the image changes while
                the report is processing, the new image will be stored and also shared until another change.
                This is recommended when the image will be printed in more than one page, then it changes and again 
                repeats in more pages. For example in a categorized price list, printing an image for each category (wines,
                cheese). Checking this option will optimize the size of the resulting MetaFile (or Adobe PDF file)
                but will hurt performance, specially for large images, because the engine must check for changes in the image
                each time is drawn

    content: Variable = 2
